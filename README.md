This project looked at specific datasets and through the use of pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. Graphs were created to model the data.
The project was created within a group of 4, and all data was recieved by official government sources.

#cases_in_schoolboard_over_time.py

This file compared the total amount of cases in a specific schoolboard over a specific period of time inputted by the user.

#individuals_vaccinated_over_time.py

This file got the amount of individuals vaccinated over time, and an end date was given to determine how much data you would like to collect.


#phu_case_resolutions.py

This file got the amount of resolved cases between two specific time periods for a specific public health unit. 

#vaccinated_vs_infected.py

This file compared the data from a vaccinated CSV and an infected CSV to compare the two data points.

#Purpose
All of these files provided an important insight into a pandemic that was still fairly new and unknown to many at the time. Through looking at the case numbers
along with the vaccinated, there was a real time display of how effective the vaccinations were.

#Running the files
Instructions to run the individual programs were given within the files. Datapoints which were used at the time are also provided, however they are not up to date, as some of the reported information is no longer updated.

#PDF
The PDFs display the data found, and allows viewers to create their own thoughts and opinions with a concise and clear display of data.
